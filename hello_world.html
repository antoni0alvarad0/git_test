    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is the beginning of my TOP journey, I will be building this Webpage will going through the course. With each lesson I go through I will add to this Webpage.</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>At the moment in time my hobbies include building and displaying LEGO sets, I have a certain passion for the vehicle sets and the Star Wars sets. I have found it to be very relaxing and mind opening. And well I guess my other hobby would be coding or at least learning to code it has open my eyes to so many wonderful opportunities of learning and creativity, that is pretty much it other than the occasional casual reading.</p>
